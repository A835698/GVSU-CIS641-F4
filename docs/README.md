# Optimized Team Maker Tool Requirements and Guidelines

## List of Tools Required:

1. **Google Form**
2. **Talend Open Studio**
3. **Python**

## Google Form Processing System

This system is designed to process data collected through a Google Form using Talend Open Studio and Python.

### Google Service Form

Students will complete a Google Service Form, providing essential details, including:

- **Timestamp**
- **G-Number**
- **First Name**
- **Last Name**
- **GVSU Mail ID**
- **Web Designing**
- **Programming (C, JAVA, PYTHON)**
- **Database (Any)**
- **IT experience (Yes/No)**

## Talend Open Studio Installation and Setup

1. **Install Talend Open Studio:**
    - Download and install Talend Open Studio from [Talend's official website](https://www.talend.com/products/data-integration/).

2. **Talend Job - Filtering and Accumulation:**
    - Import the Talend Job by downloading the [OnBoardingDemoJob_0.1.zip](https://github.com/yourusername/optimized-team-maker/raw/main/OnBoardingDemoJob_0.1.zip) from the repository.
    - In Talend Open Studio, go to `File -> Import Items -> Archive` and select the downloaded ZIP file. Import the job into your local Talend environment.
    - Configure the input to read data from the Google Form.

3. **Run Talend Job:**
    - Execute the Talend Job to process the Google Form data.

## Python Installation and Script Execution

4. **Install Python:**
    - Download and install Python from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

5. **Python Script - Data Processing:**
    - Import the Python script job named `Python_script_to_download_OT_file.py` from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yourusername/optimized-team-maker).
    - Develop a Python script to read the filtered sheet generated by Talend.
    - Implement algorithms for reading, sorting data, team assignment, and team results.
    - Convert the processed data into a CSV file.

6. **Run Python Script:**
    - Execute the Python script to process the data and generate the CSV file.

## Download Optimized Teams CSV File:

- After processing the data, customize the Python script to save optimized teams as a local CSV file.
- Enhance the script to allow users to download the CSV file to their local machines.
- Provide clear instructions in your application or documentation on initiating the download process.

## Run the send_mail.sh script:

- Execute the `send_mail.sh` script to send an auto-generated email, including the optimized teams CSV file, to the professor.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure the Google Sheets API is enabled, and credentials are set up for accessing the Google Form.
- Tailor the Talend Job and Python script to specific data processing requirements.
